# NHES-Relative-Care-Qualitative

The RCTYPE column, labeled 'Relative relation to child,' represents which relatives (excluding parents) provide the most care to the surveyed households' children. It is important to note since we as a society must be on top of how our children are cared for, and knowing which relatives they are imply a sign of the quality of this care. Ignoring skips, the clear mass of choices goes to the grandparents available, showing a benefit in wisdom and a detriment in being culturally behind and frail. Over 3/4s of the choices were skipped, implying primary parental care.
